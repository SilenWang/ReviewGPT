### Usage

This page provides two functions: Summarize and Screen.

- Summarize: Read the summary of multiple articles, summarize their content, and compare the similarities and differences among multiple studies. Further questions can be asked using prompts.
- Screen: Read the summary of articles one by one, determine whether the article meets the conditions given in the prompts, and can be used for batch screening of literature.

Currently, two input methods are provided:

- PMID: Enter the PMID directly, and call the Pumbed API provided by Biopython to obtain the summary of the literature and parse it.
- RIS format file: Can be exported in RIS format from various literature management software or online databases and uploaded for parsing.
